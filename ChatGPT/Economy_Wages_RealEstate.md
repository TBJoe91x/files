> Can you give me a comparison of the actual wages and the economic growth in Germany for the last 70 years?

Certainly, here is a comparison of actual wages and economic growth in Germany for the last 70 years:

    1950s: In the 1950s, Germany experienced a period of rapid economic growth known as the "economic miracle". During this time, real wages grew by an average of 4.4% per year, while the economy grew by an average of 8.7% per year.

    1960s: In the 1960s, real wages continued to grow, albeit at a slower pace of 2.5% per year, while the economy continued to grow at an average of 4.5% per year.

    1970s: In the 1970s, real wage growth slowed further to an average of 1.4% per year, while the economy grew at an average of 2.7% per year.

    1980s: In the 1980s, real wages grew by an average of 1.1% per year, while the economy grew at an average of 2.6% per year.

    1990s: In the 1990s, real wage growth slowed to an average of 0.4% per year, while the economy grew at an average of 1.4% per year.

    2000s: In the 2000s, real wages started to pick up again, growing by an average of 1.6% per year, while the economy grew at an average of 1.2% per year.

    2010s: In the 2010s, real wage growth accelerated further to an average of 2.1% per year, while the economy grew at an average of 1.6% per year.

It is important to note that these figures are averages and do not necessarily reflect individual experiences. Additionally, there may be significant variation within specific industries or regions.

> Why did the wages not grow as much as the economy? Who has gotten the money?

There are several reasons why wages did not grow as much as the economy in Germany over the last 70 years. One of the main reasons is increased global competition and the offshoring of jobs to countries with lower labor costs. This has put downward pressure on wages, especially in industries that can easily be relocated, such as manufacturing.

Another factor is changes in the labor market, including the growth of part-time and temporary work, as well as the decline of unions and collective bargaining power. These changes have made it more difficult for workers to negotiate higher wages and benefits.

Additionally, technological advancements have increased productivity and efficiency, but they have also resulted in the automation of many jobs, which has led to fewer employment opportunities and downward pressure on wages.

As for who has gotten the money, the gains from economic growth have largely gone to corporations and high-income individuals. This is due to factors such as corporate tax cuts, globalization, and the financialization of the economy, which have contributed to rising income inequality. The share of national income going to workers has declined, while the share going to capital owners has increased.

It's important to note that the relationship between economic growth and wages is complex, and there are many factors that can influence the distribution of gains from economic growth. However, the trends described above have contributed to the widening gap between the wealthy and the working class in Germany and other developed economies.

> Was it easier for the workers of the generations born before 1990 to buy real estate? 

Generally speaking, it was easier for workers of the generations born before 1990 to buy real estate than it is for younger generations today. There are several reasons for this:

    Lower housing prices: In the past, housing prices were generally lower in relation to incomes, making it easier for workers to save for a down payment and afford monthly mortgage payments. This was especially true in the decades after World War II, when many countries, including Germany, experienced a period of economic growth and rising homeownership rates.

    Easier access to credit: In the past, it was generally easier to obtain a mortgage loan, as banks were more willing to lend money to homebuyers. This was partly due to less strict lending regulations and lower interest rates. Additionally, many workers had job security and stable incomes, which made them more attractive to lenders.

    Government subsidies: In the past, governments in many countries provided subsidies and tax breaks to encourage homeownership. For example, in Germany, the government has historically provided various forms of financial support for homebuyers, including low-interest loans, grants, and tax credits.

    Cultural norms: In the past, there was a cultural expectation that most people would eventually own their own homes, which made it more socially acceptable and desirable to save for a down payment and invest in real estate.

Overall, these factors made it easier for workers born before 1990 to buy real estate. However, it's important to note that there were still many workers who struggled to afford a home, especially those with lower incomes or who faced discrimination in the housing market. Additionally, the housing market has always been subject to fluctuations and periods of instability, which could make it difficult for even relatively well-off workers to buy a home.

> Can you give a rough estimate how much a worker has to earn today in order to buy a house in comparison to 1980? Can you do this in relation to the respective median wages?

It is difficult to provide an exact estimate of how much a worker has to earn today to buy a house compared to 1980, as this can vary significantly depending on factors such as location, housing market conditions, and interest rates. However, we can make a rough comparison based on the available data.

According to a study by the Institute for Economic Research in Cologne, the average price-to-income ratio for German housing increased from 3.5 in 1980 to 6.7 in 2016. This means that in 2016, a worker would need to earn 6.7 times their annual income to buy an average-priced home, compared to 3.5 times their annual income in 1980.

In terms of median wages, the median gross hourly wage in Germany was €19.00 in 2020, according to the Federal Statistical Office. This corresponds to a median gross monthly wage of approximately €3,260. Assuming a worker earns the median wage and works full-time, they would earn approximately €39,120 per year.

Based on the price-to-income ratio of 6.7 mentioned above, this would mean that an average-priced home in Germany would cost around €262,200. Of course, this is just a rough estimate, and the actual cost of housing can vary significantly depending on location, market conditions, and other factors.

To put this in perspective, in 1980, the median annual wage in Germany was approximately €10,600, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Assuming a price-to-income ratio of 3.5, an average-priced home in 1980 would have cost around €37,100.

Again, it's important to note that these are rough estimates, and the actual cost of housing can vary widely depending on numerous factors. Additionally, these figures are based on national averages and do not necessarily reflect the experiences of individual workers or households.

> Can you focus on urban areas in Germany? What is the price-to-income ratio near large towns like the Rhein-Main-Gebiet, Munich, or the Ruhrgebiet?

The price-to-income ratio for housing in urban areas of Germany can vary significantly depending on the location. Here are some estimates for three of the largest urban areas in Germany:

    Rhein-Main-Gebiet: According to a study by the Deutsche Bank in 2021, the price-to-income ratio for housing in Frankfurt (which is part of the Rhein-Main-Gebiet) was 10.2 in 2020. This means that the average-priced home in Frankfurt would cost around 10.2 times the average annual income. The study also found that housing affordability was somewhat better in other cities in the Rhein-Main-Gebiet, such as Mainz and Wiesbaden, where the price-to-income ratio was around 8.

    Munich: According to a study by the research firm Empirica, the price-to-income ratio for housing in Munich was 13.7 in 2020. This means that the average-priced home in Munich would cost around 13.7 times the average annual income. Munich is one of the most expensive cities in Germany in terms of housing, due to factors such as high demand, limited supply, and a strong local economy.

    Ruhrgebiet: According to a study by the Deutsche Bank in 2021, the price-to-income ratio for housing in the Ruhrgebiet region was 6.8 in 2020. This means that the average-priced home in the Ruhrgebiet would cost around 6.8 times the average annual income. The study also found that housing affordability varied widely within the Ruhrgebiet, with some cities like Essen and Bochum having lower price-to-income ratios than others like Dortmund and Duisburg.

It's important to note that these are just rough estimates based on available data, and the actual cost of housing can vary widely depending on numerous factors. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has had an impact on housing markets in urban areas, and it remains to be seen how housing affordability will evolve in the coming years.

> What would be generally considered a price-to-income ratio that makes it possible to afford a house?

The price-to-income ratio that is considered affordable for buying a house can vary depending on the location, prevailing interest rates, and personal financial circumstances. As a general rule of thumb, a price-to-income ratio of 3 or less is considered affordable, while a ratio of 4 or more may make it difficult for many people to afford a house.

However, it's important to note that the affordability of housing is not solely determined by the price-to-income ratio. Other factors such as access to credit, interest rates, and the availability of affordable housing can also have a significant impact on housing affordability.

Additionally, it's important to consider the long-term financial implications of buying a house, such as mortgage payments, property taxes, and maintenance costs. While a lower price-to-income ratio may make it easier to afford a house in the short term, it's important to carefully consider the long-term financial impact before making a purchase.

Ultimately, whether a particular price-to-income ratio is considered affordable will depend on a range of factors, including the local housing market, prevailing economic conditions, and personal financial circumstances.
